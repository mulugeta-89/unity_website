            Library materials are organized as library reserves, which are placed at reserve desks. These materials provide instructors to access and manage course resources. Instructorsbuild, maintain and share reading lists that include all material types such as books, articles and PDF files from the Library collection and instructor personal copies for a semester or academic year. Unity University provides a reserve section in all libraries. These sections have all importantly selected and needed books for the instructors to access whenever wanted. The collection we have in the reserve section is only available for  spot reading and overnight loan.
