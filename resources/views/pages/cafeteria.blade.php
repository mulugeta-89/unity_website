            One Stop Cafe is an advantage for our students and instructors to save time, cost and other related safety issues. Our Cafe is established to provide the highest quality food and beverage for a reasonable price and home-made products. The Cafe wants to be in the business of helping our customers, to relieve their daily stresses by providing peace of mind through great ambience, convenient location and the best customer service. The Café is also providing job opportunities for the  community especially to local people.
            Along with taking advantage of this trend, the Cafe is also planning to establish branch cafés throughout all other Campuses. The Cafe is also marketing itself as a full service restaurant to maintain stability. We provide traditional and international foods and beverages (non-alcohol_) to our customers.
