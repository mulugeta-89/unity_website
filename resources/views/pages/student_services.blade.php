            Community Service and Students’ Affairs Unit is organized to carryout University community-related tasks and all students-related works. Hence, it mainly focuses on the building up of the all-rounded capacity of the surrounding community, like giving short-term training on maintaining positive relationships among community members. Moreover, it works closely with the nearby Sub-City and District Traffic Police Offices on roads management for the safe traffic movement of students, parents, pedestrians and vehicles.
